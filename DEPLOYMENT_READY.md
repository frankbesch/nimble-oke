## ðŸš€ Tomorrow's Deployment Workflow

### Prerequisites Setup (5 minutes)

```bash
# Set credentials
export NGC_API_KEY=nvapi-your-key-here
export OCI_COMPARTMENT_ID=ocid1.compartment.oc1...
export OCI_REGION=us-ashburn-1

# Verify tools
make prereqs
```

### Complete Smoke Test (5 hours, ~$12)

```bash
# 1. Provision OKE cluster with GPU nodes (30 min)
make provision CONFIRM_COST=yes

# 2. Discover cluster state (30 sec)
make discover

# 3. Deploy NIM (45-60 min first time, or 5-10 min if cached)
make install CONFIRM_COST=yes

# 4. Verify deployment (1 min)
make verify

# 5. Test operations (2 hours - your testing time)
make operate  # Shows you commands to test

# 6. Cleanup NIM deployment (1 min)
make cleanup

# 7. Teardown cluster (15 min)
make teardown
```

### Quick Test (Use Existing Cluster)

If you already have an OKE cluster with GPU nodes:

```bash
# Skip provision, start here
make discover
make install CONFIRM_COST=yes
make verify
make operate
make cleanup
```

**Time:** 1-2 hours | **Cost:** ~$3-5

---

## ðŸ§ª What to Test Tomorrow

### 1. Cost Guards

Test that cost protection works:

```bash
# Should block (cost > $5)
make install

# Should proceed
CONFIRM_COST=yes make install
```

Expected: Guard blocks, then accepts with CONFIRM_COST

### 2. Idempotency

Test scripts are safe to re-run:

```bash
# Run twice
make install
make install

# Both should succeed, second does upgrade
```

Expected: No errors, clean upgrade on second run

### 3. Cleanup Hooks

Test automatic cleanup on failure:

```bash
# Start deployment then Ctrl+C
make install
^C  # Press Ctrl+C

# Check resources
make status
```

Expected: Resources cleaned up automatically

### 4. Session Cost Tracking

Test cost calculation:

```bash
# Deploy
make install

# Wait a bit, then cleanup
sleep 300  # Wait 5 minutes
make cleanup
```

Expected: Cleanup shows session duration and estimated cost

### 5. Complete Runbook

Test full workflow:

```bash
make all  # discover â†’ install â†’ verify
```

Expected: Complete workflow executes without errors

- [ ] NGC API key generated (nvapi-...)
- [ ] API key tested and valid

### Local Tools
- [ ] OCI CLI installed and configured
  ```bash
  oci iam region list  # Should work
  ```
- [ ] kubectl installed
  ```bash
  kubectl version --client  # Should show version
  ```
- [ ] Helm 3+ installed
  ```bash
  helm version  # Should show v3.x
  ```
- [ ] jq installed
  ```bash
  jq --version  # Should work
  ```
- [ ] bc installed (usually pre-installed)
  ```bash
  bc --version  # Should work
  ```

### Budget & Planning
- [ ] $12-15 budget allocated for smoke test
- [ ] 5-hour time window available
- [ ] OCI budget alerts configured (recommended)

## ðŸŽ¯ Testing Scenarios for Tomorrow

### Scenario 1: Full Smoke Test (Recommended First)

**Goal:** Validate complete platform end-to-end

**Steps:**
1. Provision cluster
2. Deploy NIM
3. Wait for model download (30-45 min)
4. Test inference API
5. Verify all features work
6. Complete cleanup

**Time:** 5 hours  
**Cost:** ~$12  
**Validates:** Everything

### Scenario 2: Rapid Iteration Test

**Goal:** Test with model caching

**Steps:**
1. Deploy NIM (first time - 45 min)
2. Test briefly
3. Cleanup with KEEP_CACHE=yes
4. Re-deploy (second time - 5 min, cached)
5. Test again
6. Full cleanup

**Time:** 2 hours  
**Cost:** ~$4-6  
**Validates:** Caching and rapid iteration

### Scenario 3: Cost Guard Testing

**Goal:** Validate cost protection

**Steps:**
1. Try: make install (without CONFIRM_COST)
   - Expected: Blocked
2. Try: CONFIRM_COST=yes make install
   - Expected: Proceeds
3. Test ENVIRONMENT=production
   - Expected: Extra confirmation

**Time:** 15 minutes  
**Cost:** $0 (just testing guards)  
**Validates:** Cost protection system

---

## ðŸ“Š Expected Costs Tomorrow

| Scenario | Duration | Estimated Cost |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| Full smoke test | 5 hours | ~$12 |
| Rapid iteration | 2 hours | ~$4-6 |
| Cost guard testing only | 15 min | $0 |
| Extended testing | 10 hours | ~$20-25 |

**Remember:** Always run `make cleanup` and `make teardown` to stop charges!

## ðŸ†˜ If Something Goes Wrong Tomorrow

### Quick Troubleshooting

```bash
# Deployment fails
make troubleshoot  # Comprehensive diagnostics

# Check logs
make logs

# Check status
make status

# Get detailed pod info
kubectl get pods -n default -l app.kubernetes.io/name=nvidia-nim
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n default
```

### Common Issues and Fixes

**GPU quota error:**
```
Error: Out of host capacity for VM.GPU.A10.1
```
Fix: Request GPU quota increase in OCI Console

**NGC API key invalid:**
```
[NIM-OKE][ERROR] NGC_API_KEY not set
```
Fix: `export NGC_API_KEY=nvapi-...`

**Pods pending:**
```bash
make troubleshoot  # Will identify the issue
```

### Emergency Cleanup

If you need to stop everything immediately:

```bash
# Force cleanup NIM
FORCE=yes make cleanup

# Force teardown cluster
FORCE=yes make teardown

# Verify nothing running
make discover
```

- [ ] API responding (curl tests work)
- [ ] Cost guards triggered correctly
- [ ] Idempotency verified (re-run works)
- [ ] Cleanup hooks tested (Ctrl+C test)
- [ ] Session cost calculated (make cleanup shows cost)
- [ ] Cluster torn down (make teardown)
