## Model Storage Deep Dive

### Oracle Blog: OCI Object Storage

**Architecture:**
```
┌─────────────────┐
│  OCI Object     │
│  Storage        │ ← Centralized model repository
│  (Bucket)       │
└────────┬────────┘
         │ Download on pod start
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  NIM Pod        │
│  (ephemeral)    │ ← Models downloaded each deployment
└─────────────────┘
```

**Advantages:**
1. **Centralized management** - Single source of truth for models across clusters/regions
2. **Version control** - Easy model versioning and rollback via Object Storage lifecycle policies
3. **Multi-cluster sharing** - Same model repository for dev/stage/prod
4. **Cost-effective long-term storage** - Object Storage cheaper than block volumes at scale
5. **Access control** - IAM policies, pre-authenticated requests, encryption at rest
6. **Decoupled lifecycle** - Models persist independently of cluster/pod lifecycle

**Disadvantages:**
1. **Slower cold starts** - Model download from Object Storage on every pod start (50-100GB)
2. **Network dependency** - Inference startup requires stable network to Object Storage
3. **Egress costs** - Repeated downloads increase network transfer costs
4. **Complexity** - Requires Object Storage bucket setup, IAM policies, FUSE/S3FS mounting or init containers
5. **Local caching challenges** - Pod-level caching still requires block volumes for warm restarts

**Best For:** Production deployments with multiple environments, centralized ML Ops, long-running services.

---

### Nimble OKE: OCI Block Volume (PVC)

**Architecture:**
```
┌─────────────────┐
│  NIM Pod        │
│                 │
│  ┌───────────┐  │
│  │ /model-   │  │ ← PVC mounted directly
│  │  cache    │  │
│  └─────┬─────┘  │
└────────┼────────┘
         │ Persistent across pod restarts
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  OCI Block      │
│  Volume PVC     │ ← 50-200Gi, survives pod deletion
│  (oci-bv)       │
└─────────────────┘
```

**Advantages:**
1. **Fastest warm starts** - Models cached locally, no download after first pull
2. **Lower latency** - Block storage attached directly to node (sub-millisecond access)
3. **Simple architecture** - Single PVC, no external dependencies
4. **Cost-effective for testing** - Pay only during test duration, delete after
5. **Idempotent caching** - `KEEP_CACHE=yes` preserves models across cleanup cycles
6. **No network dependency** - Startup doesn't require external connectivity after first download

**Disadvantages:**
1. **Not shareable** - Each cluster needs separate model cache (no cross-cluster sharing)
2. **Manual versioning** - Model updates require PVC deletion or manual cache invalidation
3. **Higher storage cost** - Block volumes more expensive than Object Storage for long-term retention
4. **Single-cluster scope** - Models not reusable across dev/stage/prod without duplication
5. **Orphaned resources risk** - Forgot cleanup means paying for unused block volumes

**Best For:** Rapid iteration, smoke testing, cost-sensitive development, single-cluster workflows.

## Recommendations for Nimble OKE

### High-Priority Improvements

| Enhancement | Implementation | Benefit | Effort |
|-------------|---------------|---------|---------|
| **Hybrid Storage Strategy** | `model.source: "object-storage"` or `"pvc"`<br/>OCI Object Storage integration<br/>Init container for model download | Supports both rapid testing (PVC) and production patterns (Object Storage) without architectural rewrites | Medium (8-12 hours) |
| **Performance Benchmarking** | GenAI-Perf script integration<br/>Measure tokens/sec, latency p50/p90/p99<br/>GPU utilization tracking | Data-driven optimization; validates 12-48min deployment claims; identifies bottlenecks | Low (2-4 hours) |
| **Enhanced Monitoring** | Prometheus + Grafana integration<br/>GPU utilization, inference metrics<br/>ServiceMonitor + dashboards | Visibility into performance degradation; aligns with production best practices | Medium (6-10 hours) |

---

#### 4. **Model Optimization Pipeline**

**Current:** Uses stock NIM images (no optimization).

**Oracle Blog Recommendation:** TensorRT-LLM, quantization, pruning for reduced latency and memory.

**Implementation Strategy:**
```bash
# Future enhancement: pre-optimized model support
model:
  optimization:
    enabled: false  # Default: stock NIM
    tensorrt: true  # Enable TensorRT-LLM optimization
    quantization: "int8"  # int8, fp16, or none
    pruning: false  # Model pruning for smaller footprint
```

**Trade-off Analysis:**
- **Pros:** 2-4× faster inference, lower memory usage, higher throughput
- **Cons:** Model accuracy may decrease (quantization); optimization adds 30-60min to first deployment
- **Verdict:** Not needed for smoke testing; critical for production

**Recommendation:** Document as optional production enhancement; keep stock NIM for dev/test.

**Effort:** High (16-24 hours) - requires TensorRT-LLM integration, quantization testing, accuracy validation.

---

#### 5. **Autoscaling Support** (Production Path)

**Current:** Single replica, manual scaling.

**Oracle Blog Pattern:** Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) based on GPU utilization or request rate.

**Implementation:**
```yaml
# helm/values.yaml
autoscaling:
  enabled: false  # Disabled for dev/test
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 5
  metrics:
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: nvidia.com/gpu
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 80
    - type: Pods
      pods:
        metric:
          name: nim_requests_per_second
        target:
          type: AverageValue
          averageValue: "100"
```

**Benefit:** Production-grade elasticity; cost optimization during low demand.

**Effort:** Low (2-4 hours) - HPA already scaffolded in `values.yaml`, needs testing.

---

### Medium-Priority Improvements

| Enhancement | Implementation | Benefit | Effort |
|-------------|---------------|---------|---------|
| **Multi-Region Model Replication** | OCI Object Storage replication policies<br/>Region-aware model source config | Disaster recovery; lower latency for multi-region deployments | Medium (8-12 hours) |
| **Security Enhancements** | Network policies, RBAC, custom seccomp profile<br/>Pod Security Standards compliance | Meets enterprise security standards; enables production deployment | Medium (6-10 hours) |
| **Cost Optimization: Spot Instances** | OCI preemptible instances support<br/>`PREEMPTIBLE=true` flag | 50-70% cost reduction for fault-tolerant workloads | Low (2-4 hours) |

---

### Low-Priority Enhancements

| Enhancement | Implementation | Benefit | Effort |
|-------------|---------------|---------|---------|
| **Distributed Tracing** | OpenTelemetry integration<br/>Jaeger deployment | Debug latency issues, track requests across replicas | High (16-24 hours) |
| **GitOps Integration** | ArgoCD for continuous delivery<br/>Application manifests, sync policies | Aligns with `.cursorrules` preference; enables CD pipelines | Medium (8-12 hours) |

## Corrections to Nimble OKE

### Critical Corrections

#### C1. **PVC Size Discrepancy**

**Issue:** `values.yaml` has conflicting PVC sizes:
- Line 25: `model.cache.size: "200Gi"`
- Line 66: `persistence.size: 50Gi`

**Impact:** Deployment uses 50Gi (too small for large models); `model.cache.size` is unused.

**Fix:**
```yaml
# helm/values.yaml
persistence:
  enabled: true
  storageClass: "oci-bv"
  accessMode: ReadWriteOnce
  size: 200Gi  # Changed from 50Gi
  mountPath: /model-cache

# Remove unused model.cache section (lines 20-25)
```

**Verification:**
```bash
kubectl get pvc -n default
# Should show 200Gi, not 50Gi
```

---

#### C2. **nodeSelector Mismatch**

**Issue:** `values.yaml` line 84 uses:
```yaml
nodeSelector:
  nvidia.com/gpu.product: NVIDIA-A10
```

But `deploy.sh` overrides with:
```yaml
nodeSelector:
  nvidia.com/gpu.present: "true"
```

**Impact:** Inconsistent node selection; may schedule on non-A10 GPUs if present.

**Fix:** Align both to use `nvidia.com/gpu.present: "true"` (more flexible) or document override behavior.

```yaml
# helm/values.yaml - standardize
nodeSelector:
  nvidia.com/gpu.present: "true"  # Matches deploy.sh override
```

---

#### C3. **Health Probe Timing Aggressiveness**

**Current:**
```yaml
readinessProbe:
  initialDelaySeconds: 15  # Reduced from 30s
  periodSeconds: 5         # Reduced from 10s
```

**Issue:** May cause false-positive failures on slower model loads (70B+ models).

**Oracle Blog Approach:** Likely uses longer delays for large models.

**Fix:** Make probe timings configurable per model size:
```yaml
# values.yaml
probes:
  profile: "small"  # small (8B), medium (13-70B), large (70B+)
  small:
    readiness:
      initialDelaySeconds: 15
      periodSeconds: 5
  medium:
    readiness:
      initialDelaySeconds: 60
      periodSeconds: 10
  large:
    readiness:
      initialDelaySeconds: 120
      periodSeconds: 15
```

---

### Minor Corrections

#### C4. **Cost Estimation Includes Load Balancer**

**Issue:** Cost estimates include $6.25 for Load Balancer (5 hours × $1.25/hr).

**Reality Check:** OCI flexible Load Balancer pricing is bandwidth-based, not hourly.
- 10 Mbps shape: $0.0144/hr = $0.07 for 5 hours (not $6.25)
- Bandwidth charges: $0.0085/GB

**Fix:** Update cost calculation in `_lib.sh`:
```bash
estimate_deployment_cost() {
    local hours=$1
    local gpu_cost=$(echo "$hours * 2.62" | bc -l)  # VM.GPU.A10.1
    local control_plane=$(echo "$hours * 0.10" | bc -l)
    local enhanced=$(echo "$hours * 0.10" | bc -l)
    local storage=0.25  # ~$0.05/hr for 200GB
    local lb=$(echo "$hours * 0.0144" | bc -l)  # 10 Mbps flexible LB
    
    echo "$gpu_cost + $control_plane + $enhanced + $storage + $lb" | bc -l
}
```

**Corrected 5-hour estimate:** $13.10 + $0.50 + $0.50 + $0.25 + $0.07 = **$14.42** (not $15.10)

---

#### C5. **Missing Model Access Verification**

**Current:** `prereqs.sh` validates NGC API key format but doesn't verify model access.

**Oracle Blog Implication:** Should validate NGC entitlements before deployment.

**Enhancement:**
```bash
# scripts/prereqs.sh addition
check_ngc_model_access() {
    local model="meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct"
    log_info "Checking NGC model access: $model"
    
    if ! curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $NGC_API_KEY" \
         "https://api.ngc.nvidia.com/v2/models/$model" | jq -e '.modelId' &>/dev/null; then
        log_error "NGC API key lacks access to $model"
        return 1
    fi
    
    log_success "NGC model access verified"
}
```
