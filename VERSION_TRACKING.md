# Version Tracking - Nimble OKE

## Current Version: v0.1.0-20251013-dev

**Status:** First version under active development  
**Created:** October 13, 2025  
**Last Updated:** October 13, 2025  

## Version History

### v0.1.0-20251013-dev (Current - October 13, 2025)

**Development Status:** First version under active development

#### What's Implemented:
- ✅ Complete testing framework with simulation scripts
- ✅ Environment configuration for Chicago region
- ✅ NGC API key validation
- ✅ Cost simulation and optimization analysis
- ✅ Security optimization for NIM compatibility
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Mathematical performance modeling (48min → 12min optimization)
- ✅ Failure detection and troubleshooting frameworks

#### What Needs Testing:
- ⏳ GPU quota approval (CAM-247648)
- ⏳ Actual cluster provisioning
- ⏳ Real NIM deployment validation
- ⏳ Performance timing validation
- ⏳ Cost validation with actual resources

#### Key Features:
- **Simulation Framework**: Complete pre-deployment testing without infrastructure costs
- **Cost Optimization**: 70% deployment time reduction through caching strategies
- **Security Optimization**: NIM-compatible security settings
- **Mathematical Modeling**: Realistic performance and cost projections
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Failure detection and rapid iteration optimization

#### Known Limitations:
- All performance estimates are simulated (not validated with real deployment)
- All cost estimates are simulated (not validated with actual billing)
- Security settings optimized for deployment success (not maximum security)
- Topology spread constraints disabled for single-zone testing

#### Next Steps:
1. **GPU Quota Approval**: Wait for CAM-247648 approval
2. **Initial Deployment**: Validate all configurations with real infrastructure
3. **Performance Validation**: Measure actual deployment times vs simulated
4. **Cost Validation**: Verify actual costs vs projected costs
5. **Security Hardening**: Implement custom seccomp profile after validation

## Development Philosophy

**Version 0.1.0-dev represents the first iteration** of Nimble OKE. This version prioritizes:

1. **Deployment Success**: Optimized configurations for successful initial deployment
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive simulation framework without infrastructure costs
3. **Documentation**: Complete technical analysis and optimization guides
4. **Learning Focus**: Demonstrates technical competence and optimization strategies

**Future versions will focus on:**
- Real-world performance validation
- Production security hardening
- Advanced optimization features
- Multi-region support
- Enhanced monitoring and observability

## Version Numbering

- **v0.1.0-20251013-dev**: First development version (current)
- **v0.1.0**: First stable version (after GPU quota validation)
- **v0.2.0**: Performance-validated version (after real deployment testing)
- **v1.0.0**: Production-ready version (after comprehensive validation)

## Testing Requirements

Before moving to v0.1.0 (stable):
- [ ] GPU quota approval and cluster provisioning
- [ ] Successful NIM deployment
- [ ] Performance timing validation
- [ ] Cost validation with actual billing
- [ ] Security configuration validation
- [ ] End-to-end workflow validation

## Contributing

This is the first version under active development. All feedback, testing results, and optimization suggestions are welcome as we work toward a validated, stable release.
